GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network services.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
allow you to share and change the works. By contrast, our Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our licenses protect your freedoms with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software and in return for your doing so, ask you to pass on the same
freedoms to others.

Our licenses are suited for most kinds of software. However, there is a
special problem for programs that interact with users through a network.
For example, a software-as-a-service server that permits users to
interact with it through a network will in some cases never release its
users' copy of the program. This defeats the purpose of protecting
users' freedom to run and change the software.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
that, in such cases, the modified version running on the server must be
released to the requesting users. Therefore, section 13 was added to
clarify that conveying a modified version running over a network is
covered by the obligation to provide the source code.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to the work,
such as semiconductor mask work laws.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients"
may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission under this License, would make you directly or secondarily
liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing
it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a covered work means any form of propagation that enables
other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list would be considered "convenient and prominently visible".

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a transparent user interface, "source
code" includes all the markup, style sheets, script files and procedure
declarations from which the interface originates.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and
to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
it does not include System Libraries of the work, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files, and the source code for shared libraries
and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed
to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between
those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with a
facility for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version
3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to
convey the resulting work. The terms of the GNU General Public License
will in this case apply to the whole of the combined work.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy of the source code
that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a
fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is modified
and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. These
notices must be placed in a manner that, in effect, conveys to
the public that the work is governed by this License.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of the ways permitted in section 6a or 6b.

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and non-commercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer a equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding
Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
different server but must afford equivalent access without charge, and
you must ensure that the Corresponding Source is available for as long
as the object code is offered at that place.
e) Receive aggregate instructions to convey a copy of the object code
and Corresponding Source in one of the ways specified above, and
thereby fulfill the instructions.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions when compiled
as a whole.

When you convey a covered work, you may elect to remove any additional
permissions from that version of the work, but you must not remove any
copyright notices or notices of thereupon of patent licenses from
the larger works. You may place your own additional permissions on
modified versions.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the first
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless the copyright holder has explicitly and finally terminated your
license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify
you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 2.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Access.

You are not required to accept this License in order to access or run
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring as a
consequence of using interactive optical control, is not covered by
this License. However, acceptance is necessary for you to propagate or
modify any covered work. Those actions require your explicit consent to
this License.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patent Rights.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work based on the Program. The work thus
licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A "patent license" is any express offer by a patent owner or copyright
holder, to authorize the use of a specified patent cleared for use in
a covered work, or to authorize the making, using, or selling of that
work under a patent claim.

A "contributory patent license" is any patent license that covers,
but does not require, the use of the work.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent claim" is any patent claim
directed to making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing a
work.

If you convey a covered work, you hereby grant a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license to third parties under the
contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for
sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the covered
work or a contribution incorporated in the covered work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to you under this License for that covered work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from complying with the conditions of this License. If you
cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for conveying
from those to whom you convey, the only way you could satisfy both
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
the work.

13. Use over a Network.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if the work
is an Application Programming Interface) an opportunity to receive the
Corresponding Source of your modified version by providing access to
download the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge,
provided that the work is an Application Programming Interface. A
user interacting with the work remotely through a computer network
includes, without limitation, a user using a web browser to interact
with a web service running on the work.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you about it.

For example:

  This program is Copyright (C) year name of author.
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

If you code in a network service program, it is essential to make sure
that users can get the source code of the modified program.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed to address that.
Therefore, if you modify the program and distribute it over a network,
you must provide the source code to the users of the network service.

For example, a web application that uses this program must provide its
users with the source code of the application.
